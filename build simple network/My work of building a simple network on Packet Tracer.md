So for this little project of making a simple network :

  - I first used as asked 3 computers connected to a switch
  - I gave them the ip they had to have
  - Then I ping them to each others and everything was working properly
  - I then added a server connected to the switch and gave it an ip ( 192.168.1.254)
  - I also added a wireless router connected to the cloud, and the router is linked to the switch

- Then I fixed the router and the ip for my wireless router is 192.68.1.1
- Then to all the pc and server i gave them the gateway, which is the ip of the router 
- I can ping from the router all the pc and server it's working properly
- I changed the index.html from the server and made a website about becode
- i then added a dns for the server ip (192.168.1.254 to www.becode.org)
- And I can acces this website from the pc and this is it !
