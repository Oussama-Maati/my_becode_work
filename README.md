# My work at becode cybersecurity bootcamp

This repository documents my journey through the bootcamp at BeCode, where I am actively learning and improving my skills in various programming concepts. Below, you will find an overview of the work I have done so far.

## Python Challenge

[Python Challenge](./python_challenge) is a subfolder within this repository that contains my solutions to a series of Python coding challenges. These challenges have helped me practice and enhance my Python programming skills. Each challenge is designed to test different aspects of Python, ranging from basic syntax to more advanced concepts like algorithms and data structures.

Within the `python_challenge` subfolder, you will find a collection of Python scripts, each corresponding to a specific challenge. These scripts are accompanied by README files that provide explanations and instructions for each challenge. Feel free to explore the subfolder to see my progress and solutions.

## Build Simple Network

[Build Simple Network](./build /simple /network) is another subfolder within this repository that focuses on building a simple network. This section of my bootcamp curriculum covers the fundamental concepts of networking and explores how to construct a basic network using various technologies.

In the `build_simple_network` subfolder, you will find relevant documentation, code samples, and configuration files that demonstrate the process of building a network from scratch. This includes topics such as IP addressing, subnetting, routing, and network security. By working on these exercises, I aim to gain a solid understanding of network infrastructure and protocols.

Feel free to navigate through the repository and explore the subfolders to gain insights into my learning journey during this bootcamp.
